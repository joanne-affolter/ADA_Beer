        We have chosen to base our market analysis on two beer review sites:
        <span class= 'primary--text'> Beer Advocate </span> and
        <span class= 'primary--text'> Rate Beer</span>.
            These two sites are widely considered the go-to beer resource for
        millions of consumers each month and the benchmark for beer reviews.
        <br> Indeed, in order to understand the demand of our customers and to adapt
        our offer as well as possible, <i>isn't it worth getting information directly from them ?</i>
        <br>
        We start our work with a first data exploratory of the two websites to understand the evolution
        of the beer industry over the last years as well as the behavior of beer consumers.

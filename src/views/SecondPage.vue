      First insights from the beer reviews websites
    </p>
  </v-card>

  <v-card>
    We have chosen to base our market analysis on two beer review sites:
    <span color= 'primary'> Beer Advocate </span> and
    <span color= 'primary'> Rate Beer </span>.
    These two sites are widely considered the go-to beer resource for
    millions of consumers each month and the benchmark for beer reviews.
    Indeed, in order to understand the demand of our customers and to adapt
    our offer as well as possible, isn't it worth getting information directly from them ?

    We have chosen to base our market analysis on two beer review sites:
    <spann class= 'primary--text'> Beer Advocate </spann> and
    <span class= 'primary--text'> Rate Beer </span>.
    &emsp These two sites are widely considered the go-to beer resource for
    millions of consumers each month and the benchmark for beer reviews.
    <br> Indeed, in order to understand the demand of our customers and to adapt
    our offer as well as possible, <i>isn't it worth getting information directly from them ?</i>
